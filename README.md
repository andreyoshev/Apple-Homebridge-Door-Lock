# Apple-Homebridge-Door-Lock
Apple Homebridge â€“ Door Lock

I forked this repo because it seemed dead and I needed to fix a config typo, and add push notifications to Home.


# Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install homebridge-http using: `npm install -g homebridge-doorlock`
3. Update your configuration file.
